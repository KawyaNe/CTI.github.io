                <h6>Sea turtles are air-breathing reptiles that 
                    inhabit tropical and subtropical seas 
                    throughout the world. Their shells consist of an 
                    upper part (carapace) and a lower section 
                    (plastron). Hard scales (or scutes) cover all but 
                    the leatherback, and the number and 
                    arrangement of these scutes can be used to 
                    determine the species.
                    Most species are aquatic or semiaquatic; some 
                    are terrestrial. Turtles eat plants, animals, or 
                    both. They are toothless, have a horny beak, 
                    and range from less than 4 in. (10 cm) to more 
                    than 5 ft (1.5 m) long. They have sturdy, 
                    sprawling limbs with short feet or paddle like 
                    flippers (marine turtles). Some species bend the 
                    neck sideways, but most pull the head and neck 
                    backward into the shell. Almost half of the 
                    known turtle species are rare, threatened, or 
                    endangered.
                    After about 60 days, the eggs hatch and tiny hatchlings make their way from the nest to the water 
at night, often a deadly ordeal as seabirds, crabs, and other predators prey on the young turtles. 
Another threat comes from coastal development. Natural light at the horizon guides the hatchings 
to the ocean. Lights from hotels, homes, and other buildings can confuse the turtles into heading 
the wrong way.
